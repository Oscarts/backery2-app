## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- PostgreSQL database (Docker Compose included)
- Git

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oscarts/backery2-app.git
   cd backery2-app
   ```

2. **Start the database**

   ```bash
   # Start PostgreSQL with Docker Compose
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and setup**

   ```bash
   # Install all dependencies
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install

   # Setup the database
   npx prisma generate
   npx prisma db push
   npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts
   ```

4. **Start the development servers**

   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start:
   - Frontend: <http://localhost:3002>
   - Backend: <http://localhost:8000>
   - Database: PostgreSQL on <http://localhost:5432>

5. **Test the system**

   Navigate to <http://localhost:3002/api-test> to run the comprehensive API test suite and verify everything is working correctly.
