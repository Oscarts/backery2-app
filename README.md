- **Finished Products**: Manage final products with SKUs, pricing, and packaging information

### Recipe Management
- Create and edit recipes with detailed ingredient lists
- Cost calculation based on current ingredient prices
- Recipe scaling for different batch sizes
- Production time estimates

### Production Planning
