- All tests must pass before marking features as complete
- Server health checks required before API testing

### Documentation Standards

- API endpoints must be documented with examples
- UI patterns must be documented with code examples
- Development decisions must be recorded with rationale
- Progress tracking must include implementation details

## üîÑ Development Workflow
