# API Test Failures Diagnosis and Solution

## Root Cause

The primary reason for the 24 failing API tests is that **the backend server is not running continuously** while the tests are being executed. Most tests fail with `ECONNREFUSED` errors, indicating they cannot connect to the backend service.

## Server Stability Issues

1. When running tests and the server in the same terminal session, the server is interrupted
2. The server may be crashing due to specific test requests or error conditions
3. The tests don't properly check if the server is running before making API calls

## Solution Steps

### 1. Run Backend Server Separately

Start the backend server in a dedicated terminal and keep it running:

```bash
cd /Users/oscar/backery2-app/backend
npm run dev
```

Ensure you see: `ðŸš€ Server running on port 8000 in development mode` and keep this terminal open.

### 2. Use Enhanced Test Scripts

I've created an enhanced test script (`test-quality-status-enhanced.js`) that:

- Checks if the server is running before making API calls
- Handles errors gracefully
- Provides clear error messages and suggestions

### 3. Run Tests in a Separate Terminal

With the server running in one terminal, run your tests in another terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/oscar/backery2-app/backend
node test-quality-status-enhanced.js
```

### 4. Consider Implementing These Improvements in All Tests

To fix all 24 failing tests, apply the same pattern from the enhanced test script:

1. Check server health before running tests
2. Implement proper error handling
3. Add retry logic for intermittent failures
4. Ensure tests clean up resources even when failing

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Update run-all-tests.js**: Modify it to check server health first and provide clear guidance
2. **Use Docker Compose**: Consider using Docker Compose to ensure test environment consistency
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Add pre-test setup steps to ensure the server is running before tests

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the failing API tests and create a more robust testing environment.
