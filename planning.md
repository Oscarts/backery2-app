   - [ ] Cost calculation based on ingredient prices
   - [ ] Version control for recipe modifications

### 📊 Phase 2: Production Planning (Medium Priority)
4. **Production Dashboard**
   - [ ] Daily/weekly production schedules
   - [ ] Resource allocation and capacity planning
   - [ ] Real-time production status
   - [ ] Quality control checkpoints

5. **Batch Management**
   - [ ] Production batches with traceability
   - [ ] Quality control records
   - [ ] Yield tracking and variance analysis
   - [ ] Waste tracking and reporting

### 📊 Phase 3: Analytics & Reporting (Medium Priority)
6. **Dashboard Analytics**
   - [ ] Inventory level charts and trends
   - [ ] Cost analysis and profitability
   - [ ] Production efficiency metrics
   - [ ] Expiration alerts and notifications

7. **Reports System**
   - [ ] Inventory reports (current stock, movements, valuations)
   - [ ] Production reports (batches, yields, costs)
   - [ ] Financial reports (COGS, margins, variances)
   - [ ] Compliance reports (traceability, quality)

### 📊 Phase 4: Advanced Features (Lower Priority)
8. **Contamination Tracking**
   - [ ] Contamination incident reporting
   - [ ] Batch recall procedures
   - [ ] Root cause analysis
   - [ ] Preventive measures tracking

9. **User Management & Permissions**
   - [ ] User roles and permissions system
   - [ ] Activity logging and audit trails
   - [ ] Multi-location support
   - [ ] API authentication (JWT)

10. **Integration & Deployment**
    - [ ] Real PostgreSQL database connection
    - [ ] Environment configuration (.env files)
    - [ ] Docker containerization
    - [ ] CI/CD pipeline setup
    - [ ] Production deployment (Vercel/Netlify + Railway/Heroku)

## 🛠 Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Extensions Needed
```sql
-- Additional tables to implement:
- intermediate_products (extends base product pattern)
- finished_products (with recipe_id foreign key)
- recipes (with ingredients many-to-many relationship)
- recipe_ingredients (junction table with quantities)
- production_batches (with recipe and yield tracking)
- production_steps (cooking instructions)
- quality_controls (checkpoints and results)
- inventory_movements (stock in/out tracking)
```

### API Endpoints to Develop
```
/api/intermediate-products (CRUD)
/api/finished-products (CRUD)  
/api/recipes (CRUD + ingredient management)
/api/production (batches, scheduling)
/api/reports (various report types)
/api/analytics (dashboard data)
```

## 🎯 Immediate Next Session Goals

### Tomorrow's Focus (Recommend starting with):
1. **Intermediate Products Page**
   - Copy Raw Materials structure as foundation
   - Modify for intermediate product specific fields
   - Add recipe relationship dropdowns
   - Implement production status indicators

2. **Finished Products Page**
   - Similar structure to Raw Materials
   - Add recipe selection and ingredient breakdown
   - Include product images/descriptions
   - Implement packaging information

3. **Basic Recipe Management**
   - Start with simple recipe CRUD
   - Ingredient selection from Raw Materials
   - Basic quantity and unit management
   - Instructions text area

### Success Criteria for Next Session:
- [ ] Intermediate Products fully functional (like Raw Materials)
- [ ] Finished Products with basic CRUD operations
- [ ] Recipe management foundation laid
- [ ] All new pages integrated with navigation
- [ ] Mock data extended for new entities

## 📝 Development Best Practices Established

### Code Patterns to Follow:
1. **Page Structure**: Header with actions, search/filters, data table, forms in dialogs
2. **State Management**: React Query for server state, useState for UI state
3. **Form Handling**: Material-UI components with proper validation
4. **Error Handling**: Toast notifications with success/error states
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with Material-UI breakpoints
6. **TypeScript**: Strict typing for all entities and API responses

### Mock API Pattern:
- Simulate realistic delays (300-800ms)
- Proper error handling and validation
- CRUD operations with optimistic updates
- Local array manipulation for immediate UI feedback

## 🚀 Long-term Vision

### Production Readiness Checklist:
- [ ] Replace mock API with real backend
- [ ] Database migrations and seeding
- [ ] User authentication and authorization
- [ ] Error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security audit and testing
- [ ] Documentation and user guides

### Deployment Strategy:
- **Frontend**: Vercel or Netlify (static hosting)
- **Backend**: Railway, Heroku, or DigitalOcean (API hosting)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL on Railway, Supabase, or AWS RDS
- **File Storage**: AWS S3 or Cloudinary (for product images)
