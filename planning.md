# Bake**🎯 CURRENT STATUS: Phase 1 Complete + Core Inventory Systems Live (Raw Materials & Intermediate Products)**y Inventory Management System - Development Planning

## 📋 Project Overview

Full-stack bakery inventory management application with React TypeScript frontend, Node.js Express backend, and PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM.

### 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: Phase 1 Complete + Core Inventory Systems Live (Raw Materials & Intermediate Products)

## 🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINE - REAL API ONLY

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Use Real API for All Data Operations

**ALL frontend components MUST use `realApi.ts` and connect to the actual PostgreSQL database through the Express.js backend.**

#### ✅ ALWAYS USE

- `import { api } from '../services/realApi';`
- Real database data from PostgreSQL
- Actual HTTP requests to `http://localhost:8000/api`
- Persistent data that survives page refreshes
- Real validation and error handling from backend

#### ❌ NEVER USE

- `import { api } from '../services/mockApi';`
- Mock data or in-memory arrays
- Fake/simulated API responses
- Temporary data that resets on refresh

#### 🎯 RATIONALE

- **Real data integrity**: All features must work with actual database constraints
- **True validation**: Backend validation rules must be tested continuously
- **Production readiness**: Components must be production-ready, not demo-ready
- **Performance testing**: Real API calls reveal actual performance characteristics
- **Error handling**: Real network and database errors must be handled properly

#### 🔧 BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

- Express.js backend server MUST be running on `http://localhost:8000`
- PostgreSQL database MUST be accessible and seeded with data
- All API endpoints MUST be functional and tested
- Error handling MUST return proper HTTP status codes and messages

**This guideline ensures all development is production-ready and data integrity is maintained.**

  - ✅ **Contamination Integration**: Testing contamination status across all product types
- **Regression Testing**: All tests integrated into `run-all-tests.js` for comprehensive validation

### 🔧 **API Endpoints Verified**

#### ✅ **Quality Status Endpoints:**

```bash
GET /api/quality-statuses    # Returns {success: true, data: [...]}
POST /api/quality-statuses   # Create new quality status
PUT /api/quality-statuses/:id # Update existing
DELETE /api/quality-statuses/:id # Soft delete
```

#### ✅ **Entity Endpoints with Quality Status:**

```bash
# All return quality status data in responses
GET /api/raw-materials      # Includes qualityStatus relation
POST /api/raw-materials     # Auto-assigns default quality status
GET /api/intermediate-products # Includes qualityStatus relation  
POST /api/intermediate-products # Auto-assigns default quality status
GET /api/finished-products  # Includes qualityStatus relation
POST /api/finished-products # Auto-assigns default quality status
```

### 🎯 **Business Rules Implemented**

#### 📋 **Quality Status Rules:**

- **Sorting**: Quality statuses ordered by `sortOrder` field (ASC)
- **Default Selection**: First active quality status becomes default for new entities
- **Active Status**: Only active quality statuses available for selection
- **Data Integrity**: Quality status required for all inventory entities

#### 🔒 **Validation Rules:**

- **Quality Status ID**: Must exist and be active for entity creation
- **Default Assignment**: Automatic fallback if no quality status specified
- **Referential Integrity**: Prevents deletion of quality statuses in use

### 🚀 **Next Development Priorities**

#### ✅ **Testing Expansion (Completed):**

1. ✅ **Backend Test Setup**: Implemented Node.js test scripts with axios for API testing
2. ✅ **Integration Tests**: Implemented tests for quality status assignment across all entities
