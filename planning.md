## 🚧 Next Development Priorities

### 🎯 **IMMEDIATE NEXT STEP: Enhanced Dashboard & Analytics System**

**Priority**: Phase 3A - High Priority (This Week)
**Rationale**: With all three core inventory systems complete, we need a central dashboard to monitor and analyze the data. This provides immediate business value through real-time insights and sets up analytics infrastructure for future features.

#### **Step 1: Backend Analytics API Implementation (2-3 hours)**

**Create Dashboard Controller** (`dashboardController.ts`):
- [ ] `GET /api/dashboard/summary` - Overall inventory metrics across all systems
- [ ] `GET /api/dashboard/alerts` - Expiration & low stock alerts aggregated
- [ ] `GET /api/dashboard/trends` - Inventory trends over time with date ranges
- [ ] `GET /api/dashboard/categories` - Category breakdown and distribution
- [ ] `GET /api/dashboard/value` - Total inventory value calculations (cost vs sale price)

**Key Metrics to Track**:
- [ ] Total inventory value (raw materials + intermediate + finished products)
- [ ] Products expiring in next 7/30 days across all categories
- [ ] Low stock items with reorder level alerts
- [ ] Reserved quantities impact on available inventory
- [ ] Category distribution and stock levels
- [ ] Recent activity feed (created/updated items in last 24-48 hours)

**Update Dashboard Routes** (`dashboard.ts`):
- [ ] Connect all analytics endpoints following established patterns
- [ ] Add pagination and filtering options for large datasets
- [ ] Include date range parameters for historical trend analysis

#### **Step 2: Frontend Dashboard Page Implementation (4-5 hours)**

**Enhanced Dashboard.tsx** (following Material-UI patterns):

**Dashboard Layout Design**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Key Metrics Cards (6 cards in responsive grid)  │
│ Total Value | Expiring | Low Stock | Reserved   │
│ Raw Materials Count | Intermediate | Finished    │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Alert Section (Critical Actions Needed)        │
│ Expired Items | Expiring Soon | Out of Stock   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Category Breakdown (Visual Charts)             │
│ Inventory Distribution | Stock Levels by Type  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Recent Activity Feed (Timeline)                │
│ Recent Additions | Updates | Critical Changes  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Quick Actions (Navigation & Common Tasks)      │
│ Add Raw Material | Create Product | View Stock │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Components to Build**:
- [ ] **MetricsCard** - Reusable metric display with icons and trend indicators
- [ ] **AlertPanel** - Critical alerts with action buttons and priority sorting

- [ ] Interactive charts with drill-down to detailed inventory views
- [ ] Date range selectors for historical data analysis
- [ ] Export capabilities for reports and metrics
- [ ] Search and filter functionality across all dashboard components

#### **Step 3: API Testing & Integration (1 hour)**

**Add Dashboard Tests to ApiTest.tsx**:
- [ ] Dashboard Summary API - Test metrics calculation accuracy
- [ ] Dashboard Alerts API - Verify alert detection logic
- [ ] Dashboard Trends API - Test date range filtering and data aggregation
- [ ] Dashboard Categories API - Validate category breakdown calculations
- [ ] Dashboard Value Calculations - Test cost vs sale price analysis
- [ ] Performance testing for large datasets
- [ ] Error handling for missing data scenarios

#### **Step 4: Documentation & Refinement (1 hour)**
