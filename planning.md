# Bakery Inventory Management System - Development Planning

## 📋 Project Overview

Full-stack bakery inventory management application with React TypeScript frontend, Node.js Express backend, and PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM.

### 🎯 CURRENT STATUS: Phase 1 Complete + Core Inventory Systems Live (Raw Materials & Intermediate Products)

## 🚨 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINE - REAL API ONLY

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Use Real API for All Data Operations

**ALL frontend components MUST use `realApi.ts` and connect to the actual PostgreSQL database through the Express.js backend.**

#### ✅ ALWAYS USE

- `import { api } from '../services/realApi';`
- Real database data from PostgreSQL
- Actual HTTP requests to `http://localhost:8000/api`
- Persistent data that survives page refreshes
- Real validation and error handling from backend

#### ❌ NEVER USE

- `import { api } from '../services/mockApi';`
- Mock data or in-memory arrays
- Fake/simulated API responses
- Temporary data that resets on refresh

#### 🎯 RATIONALE

- **Real data integrity**: All features must work with actual database constraints
- **True validation**: Backend validation rules must be tested continuously
- **Production readiness**: Components must be production-ready, not demo-ready
- **Performance testing**: Real API calls reveal actual performance characteristics
- **Error handling**: Real network and database errors must be handled properly

#### 🔧 BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

- Express.js backend server MUST be running on `http://localhost:8000`
- PostgreSQL database MUST be accessible and seeded with data
- All API endpoints MUST be functional and tested
- Error handling MUST return proper HTTP status codes and messages

**This guideline ensures all development is production-ready and data integrity is maintained.**

---

## 🧪 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINE - UNIT TESTING & CODE QUALITY

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Comprehensive Testing & Quality Standards

**ALL features MUST have corresponding unit tests and meet code quality standards.**

#### ✅ TESTING REQUIREMENTS

- Each API endpoint MUST have unit tests covering:
  - Happy path (successful operations)
  - Error conditions (invalid inputs, missing data, etc.)
  - Edge cases (boundaries, large datasets, etc.)
- Frontend components MUST have:
  - Rendering tests
  - User interaction tests
  - State management tests

#### ✅ CODE QUALITY REQUIREMENTS

- All code MUST pass ESLint without errors
- TypeScript MUST be used with strict typing
- No `any` types except in exceptional cases
- Functions MUST be documented with JSDoc
- Complex logic MUST have explanatory comments

#### 🎯 RATIONALE

- **Reliability**: Tests ensure features work as expected
- **Maintainability**: Quality code is easier to maintain
- **Scalability**: Well-tested code is easier to extend
- **Documentation**: Comments help other developers understand the code
- **Prevention**: Tests prevent regressions and bugs

#### 🔧 TESTING COMMANDS

- Backend: `npm run test`
- Frontend: `npm run test:react`

**This guideline ensures all development is robust, maintainable, and reliable.**

---

## 🔄 CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT GUIDELINE - DATABASE MIGRATIONS

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Proper Database Schema Management

**ALL database schema changes MUST be handled through Prisma migrations.**

#### ✅ MIGRATION WORKFLOW

1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma` with new schema
2. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name descriptive_name`
3. Update related models, controllers, and services
4. Update tests to cover new schema
5. Document changes in schema documentation

#### ❌ NEVER

- Manually modify the database schema
- Skip the migration process
- Leave migrations untested
- Deploy without running migrations

#### 🎯 RATIONALE

- **Version control**: Migrations provide a history of schema changes
- **Consistency**: All environments use the same schema
- **Rollback**: Migrations can be rolled back if needed
- **Documentation**: Migrations document schema changes
- **Automation**: Migrations can be run automatically during deployment

**This guideline ensures database schema changes are controlled, documented, and consistent across environments.**
