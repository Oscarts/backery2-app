## Future Development

For future development cycles, remember to:

1. Follow the coding guidelines in `planning.md`
2. Use real API calls only, no mock data
3. Run backend server separately before running API tests
4. Document all new features in CHANGELOG.md
5. Update MODULES.md with any architectural changes

The system is now well-documented and ready for publication. All changes have been carefully tracked and explained, making future development and maintenance much easier.
